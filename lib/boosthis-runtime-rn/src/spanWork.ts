/** BOOSTHIS_SPAN_WORK_V1 — what KIND of work a span measured, and whether it
 *  WORKED.
 *
 *  This kit's copy of the shared vocabulary in `lib/span-wire-vocabulary.json`.
 *  Every runtime carries the same eight kind names and the same two outcome
 *  names, spelled identically, so "a database query" found by this kit and by
 *  a Go service meet in one place on the server instead of splitting into two.
 *
 *  THE FIELDS ARE OPTIONAL AND ABSENCE IS NOT A VALUE. A span with no `kind`
 *  came from a kit that does not report one; it is not a handler, and it is not
 *  `other`. A span with no `outcome` is not "ok" — nothing was said about it.
 *  The server stores both as absent and every reading says "not reporting"
 *  rather than inventing a clean result.
 *
 *  A value not on these lists is dropped at the door rather than refusing the
 *  batch. Adding one means adding it to the shared JSON first, then to every
 *  kit's copy, then to the server's stored enum — never here alone.
