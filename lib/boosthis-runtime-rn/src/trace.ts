/** Full-stack trace tag — the correlation id that stitches one user action
 * across all three Boosthis runtimes (RN → Node → Python).
 *
 * This is Stage 1 of the flagship cross-runtime trace: PROPAGATION + PROOF.
 * It does not store or upload anything — it only mints/validates/forwards a
 * privacy-safe id so a single "Tap → API → worker" round-trip can be
 * correlated later.
 *
 * PRIVACY CONTRACT (verified against no-pii.ts):
 *  - The id is exactly 32 lowercase hex chars (128 random bits). Pure hex
 *    cannot match the PII guard's email/JWT/bearer/IPv4/IPv6/phone value
 *    patterns in the general walk(), and the UUID / long-numeric checks apply
 *    ONLY to route labels — never to a general field. The field key `traceId`
 *    tokenizes to ["trace","id"] (neither denied), so `{ traceId }` and the
 *    `x-boosthis-trace` header are guard-clean.
 *  - It is random, ephemeral, and NEVER derived from user data.
 *
 * ⚠️  A trace id must NEVER be used as (or embedded in) a route/screen label.
 *     `routeLabelHasPII` rejects long-numeric runs and Node's `normalizePath`
 *     redacts 24+ char tokens, so a digit-edged trace id would be flagged as a
 *     URL identifier. Keep trace ids in their own header/field only.
 *
 * This module is intentionally PURE — no react / react-native imports — so the
 * demo driver (and any non-UI caller) can import it without pulling the RN
 * barrel (which loads React).
