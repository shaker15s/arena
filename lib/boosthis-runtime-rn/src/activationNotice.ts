/**
 * What the kit says while it waits for its FIRST confirmation from Boosthis —
 * the one state in which a perfectly installed kit draws nothing at all.
 *
 * WHY (observed on a live customer project, Aug 2026, on the browser kit; the
 * same hole exists here): a first-ever launch holds no credential, so the
 * anti-copy ACTIVATION LOCK keeps the bubble hidden until the server confirms
 * this install. That confirmation took 22 minutes, and for the whole of the
 * developer's first sitting nothing was said: the startup line ends on
 * "Registering next." and is then followed by silence. An empty corner with no
 * explanation reads as a broken install — the developer reported no badge, and
 * the AI helping them invented a cause and edited their startup path. Waiting
 * is a legitimate state. Being silent about it is not.
 *
 * The budget is TWO lines per launch, and only for a wait long enough to be
 * worth a word: one when the wait becomes real, one for how it ended. Both are
 * ungated `console.info` — a privacy setting never silences them, because they
 * reveal nothing but the state of the install itself. They are skipped
 * entirely when the bubble was switched off by a setting, since the startup
 * line has already explained that empty corner and a second, contrary
 * explanation is worse than none (the same "never contradict the badge" rule
 * the startup line obeys).
