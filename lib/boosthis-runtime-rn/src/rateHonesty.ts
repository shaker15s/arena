/* ─── Boosthis: the earned-rate contract (RN) ────────────────────────────
 *
 * ONE rule, shared by every rate-per-time reading in this kit:
 *
 *   NO READING MAY EXTRAPOLATE MORE THAN TWELVEFOLD. A projection to a unit
 *   may only be published from an observation window of at least a twelfth of
 *   that unit — five minutes for a per-hour figure, five seconds for a
 *   per-minute one. Below that the projection is withheld, and so is any score
 *   or rating derived from it, while the raw count and the window actually
 *   observed are still reported.
 *
 * WHY: a per-hour projection multiplies what it saw by 3600/observed. At 96
 * seconds that factor is 37x, so a handful of errors becomes a confident-
 * sounding "308 errors/hour" the observation never earned. Capping the
 * extrapolation — rather than fixing one wall-clock minimum for every unit —
 * is what makes the same rule honest for an hourly crash rate and for a
 * per-minute reading on a page that is only open for two minutes.
 *
 * EVENTS ARE NEVER HIDDEN BY THIS RULE. A crash, an unhandled error, a hang —
 * the COUNT surfaces the moment it happens. What a short window withholds is
 * the projection and the judgement, never the event itself.
 *
 * NOT for slopes fitted over samples (heap MB/min) or ratios over a completed
 * sample (error %) — nothing is extrapolated there. See
 * docs/rate-honesty-contract.md, and the guard in
 * scripts/src/__tests__/rate-honesty-contract.test.ts.
 *
 * This module is duplicated verbatim in every kit on purpose: a kit ships to
 * the customer as standalone source and may not import a sibling package.

/** The observation window in MINUTES, at the precision that decides honestly.
 *  Never rounded UP to time we did not watch: "1m observed" after thirty
 *  seconds is the same fabrication as a rate the window has not earned, one
 *  level down. The wording layer decides how to SAY it; this only refuses to
 *  lose the truth.
 *
 *  FLOORED TO A WHOLE SECOND. The far side re-judges eligibility from the
 *  window we report, so this one number has two jobs, and only a second-
 *  grained floor does both:
 *
 *    • It may never overstate the observation. A window rounded UP across the
 *      line (4m59.7s → "5.00") hands the reader four minutes fifty-nine
 *      seconds dressed as an earned five.
 *    • It must decide exactly as the raw milliseconds do. Both minimums are a
 *      whole number of seconds — 300s for a per-hour projection, 5s for a
 *      per-minute one — so flooring to a second changes no verdict: 5.000s
 *      reports 5/60 of a minute and earns, 4.999s reports 4/60 and does not.
 *      A two-decimal minute cannot manage that. A twelfth of a minute is
 *      0.0833…, so an earned five-second look truncates to "0.08", falls
 *      short of the threshold on arrival, and is refused by the very rule it
 *      satisfied — a rate the observation DID earn, withheld at the edge.
 *
 *  Eligibility on this side is still decided on the raw elapsed milliseconds.
 *  This value exists to be REPORTED, and to let the far side reach the same
 *  verdict from what it receives. */
