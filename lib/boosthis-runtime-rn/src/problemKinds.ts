/* ─── Boosthis: the shared problem vocabulary (React Native copy) ─────
 *
 * Every Boosthis kit, in every language, reports a problem under a name from
 * THIS list. One name per problem means the same problem found by a Go service
 * and by this app meet in one place on the server instead of splitting into two
 * spellings that never group.
 *
 * The list is a copy. The one true list is `lib/problem-kinds.json` at the repo
 * root, which also carries the plain-English meaning of each name; the guard in
 * `scripts/src/__tests__/kitProblemReporting.test.ts` fails the build if this
 * copy and that list ever disagree. A kit therefore cannot invent a spelling:
 * adding a detector means adding its name to the shared list first.
 *
 * What a kit must accumulate and upload — signature rules, the local
 * occurrence threshold, the batch cap and the consent gates — is written down
 * once in `docs/kit-problem-reporting-contract.md`.
