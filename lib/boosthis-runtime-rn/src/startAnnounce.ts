/** The two ungated lines every Boosthis kit says about switching itself on.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * A kit that never started is perfectly silent: it draws nothing, contacts
 * nobody and appears nowhere — which is indistinguishable from a kit that is
 * running quietly by choice. A real customer install was misdiagnosed for two
 * days on exactly that ambiguity (sandboxes and key rotations were blamed; the
 * start call had simply never run).
 *
 * So every kit now says ONE short line the moment its start path begins:
 *
 *   [boosthis] Boosthis starting: project key ...1a2b. Registering next.
 *
 * That line is the anchor for every diagnosis. No line means the kit never
 * started, whatever anyone else believes. It is never silenced by a quiet
 * mode, a privacy setting or a switched-off badge, because it reveals nothing
 * about the app: a four-character tail of a key the developer already holds.
 *
 * The second line refuses a value that cannot be a project key AT THE POINT IT
 * IS SUPPLIED. The same install pasted `Bearer bk_...` (the way an HTTP header
 * shows a key) and the failure surfaced three layers away as a refused
 * registration with no explanation. Nothing is ever stripped or repaired
 * silently — a wrong value is reported and refused.
 *
 * The wording is duplicated verbatim in every kit ON PURPOSE (no server prose
 * ever renders inside a host app) and a cross-runtime guard greps each phrase
 * as a contiguous literal. See .agents/memory/kit-startup-announcement.md.
