/** Full-stack trace — Stage 2: span emission (React Native root layer).
 *
 * Stage 1 (see `trace.ts`) only *propagated* a 32-hex correlation id on the
 * `x-boosthis-trace` header. Stage 2 lets the RN layer emit ONE privacy-safe
 * root span per outbound request so the server can stitch a waterfall
 * (RN → Node → Python) keyed by that id.
 *
 * A span is a tiny, closed, code-derived shape:
 *   { traceId, layer:"rn", routeLabel, durationMs, startOffsetMs, rating }
 *
 * `routeLabel` is `${METHOD} ${normalizeApiPath(url)}` (ids redacted), capped at
 * 100 chars — the SAME normalization the per-screen sampler uses, so no raw
 * path segment (numeric/uuid/mixed-alnum id) ever travels. Nothing here is
 * screen-bearing beyond that code-defined label, and it rides the SAME PII guard
 * as every other transmit (see `telemetry.transmitSpans`).
 *
 * PRIVACY-BY-DEFAULT: `enqueueSpan` is a no-op until a submitter is wired. The
 * telemetry client only wires the span submitter when the snapshot mirror is
 * allowed (full mode, or issues-only after the developer connects an AI), so a
 * private app RETAINS nothing span-shaped until sharing is authorized. The
 * emergency kill-switch (`BOOSTHIS_DISABLED`) and `forget()` both stop and clear
 * it, exactly like the snapshot mirror.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort: span bookkeeping must NEVER change the host
 * request's behavior or crash the app, so `traceFetch` records the span in a
 * `finally` and swallows any error from that path.
