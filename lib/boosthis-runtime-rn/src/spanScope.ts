/** Active-span scope — the half of full-stack causality that answers "which
 *  call is open right NOW?".
 *
 *  The trace primitives in trace.ts correlate hops: everything that carries the
 *  same 32-hex trace id belongs to one user action. What they cannot say is
 *  which hop CAUSED which — a trace assembled from a shared id and a set of
 *  start offsets is a timeline, not a tree. These two ids are the difference:
 *
 *    • `spanId`       — this call's own identity, minted here.
 *    • `parentSpanId` — the identity of the call that caused it, taken from the
 *                       scope open at the call site, or adopted from the
 *                       `x-boosthis-trace-parent` header on the way in.
 *
 *  ADOPT-OR-DROP, never adopt-or-mint. `sanitizeTraceId` mints a fresh id when
 *  it is handed a bad one, because a trace with a re-minted id is still a valid
 *  trace. A re-minted PARENT would be a fabricated cause: it would point at a
 *  call that does not exist, and the reader has no way to tell that from a real
 *  one. So a malformed or missing parent becomes null and the span is simply
 *  top-level. Boosthis never guesses causality.
 *
 *  CONCURRENCY HONESTY. The ambient scope is SYNCHRONOUS only: `runInSpan`
 *  closes the scope the moment its callback returns, so an `await` inside the
 *  callback does not hold it open. JavaScript runs one stack at a time, so a
 *  synchronous scope can never attribute two calls that are genuinely in
 *  flight together to each other. Holding a scope across an await would look
 *  richer and be wrong — two parallel fetches would come back as parent and
 *  child. A wrong parent is worse than no parent, because a flat trace is
 *  visibly flat while a wrong tree reads as the truth.
 *
 *  PRIVACY CONTRACT (verified against no-pii.ts): a span id is exactly 16
 *  lowercase hex characters (64 random bits). Pure hex cannot match the guard's
 *  email/JWT/bearer/IP/phone value patterns, and the keys `spanId` /
 *  `parentSpanId` / the `x-boosthis-trace-parent` header tokenize to words that
 *  are not denied. It is random, ephemeral, and never derived from user data.
 *
 *  ⚠️  Like a trace id, a span id must NEVER appear in a route/screen label.
 *
 *  This module is intentionally PURE — no React Native imports — so any
 *  caller can import it freely.
